title: Hell or High Water (otherwise known as slapping Fate in the face)
---

As an independent contractor, I define my own project completion dates. 
When calculating the completion time of any task given to me, I take 
into account all of the usual things; difficulty of the task at hand, 
my current free time to work on a project, personal commitments, etc. 
When I give my estimated time to completion, I follow a &ldquo;Hell or 
High Water&rdquo; approach; this usually works out fine for me.

But what does one do when life throws a grenade? No one can plan for 
everything, and some things are just too demanding to put off until 
after the project is completed.

In my case, the client usually gets a large discount; I've wasted their 
time and wasn't able to finish. This is a very straightforward and 
ethical approach to the problem, but how can one tell what the 
**right** solution is?
